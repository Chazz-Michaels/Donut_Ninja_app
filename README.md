# README

Welcome to Donut Ninja. This game will help you learn that you
cannot avoid donuts forever because they are just too good.


Controls:
Spacebar = jump
X = shoot fireball


Objective:
Click anywhere on the screen to start a new game from the Start
Game or Game Over screens.

Avoid the donuts by moving Ken (main character) up or letting
him fall down. If Ken collides with a donut, he will be pushed
to the left of the screen. For each time Ken slays a dragon with
a fireball, he is pushed to the right a bit. If Ken disappears
off the left side of the screen, game over. Also the game ends
when Ken comes into contact with Lava, or with Dragon.


Note:
This game is built almost exclusively with Javascript. This is my
first project and I built everything, including the engine, myself-
I am working on removing any bugs I find and optimizing the code. Any
help/feedback is appreciated.


If you like this game please help me get #DonutNinja trending!
